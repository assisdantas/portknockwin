# PortKnockWin
Port knocking tool for Windows

Version 1 only works with TCP ports, as it is an initial build. I'm already implementing UDP support and I'll commit soon. If you want to contribute to the development, remember to credit the "about" screen and comment on your change.
Developed in IDE Delphi Community Edition 10.4 using Indy components.
